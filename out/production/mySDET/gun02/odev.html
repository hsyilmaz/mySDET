<p> Starting dates: 1 Sep 2020 1 Oct 2020.</p>
<p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better
if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>
    <u1>

        <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
        <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
    </u1>
<p> Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
